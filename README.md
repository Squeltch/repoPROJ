# Final thoughts on Final Project...
Well, seeing how its not done, I am a bit bothered by how it turned out. 
I know I gave it a good effort, and got far (for a Java noob)
but I can't help myself dreaming of overcoming the problems I faced quicker, and being smarter with my time.

The biggest challeneg I faced, without a doubt was time management.
The fact of the matter is that I didn't know what I didn't know, and 
I ended up wasting precious time trying to solve problems in ways that
were just not compatible with Java. For instance, in trying to set up the
2D array interface, I consulted copious amounts of resources, trying to see
if I could land on just the right tool to use for the job, watching video after video,
only to find out after 3 hours of searching that the way I was trying to 
solve the problem was impossible, because Java wasn't made to be able to do that 
kind of work in that way. At least they had a built in function for me to use, but the 
time was still long gone.

I did learn something out of the struggle, though. And it was that Prof. Rosen was right; being clever
just isn't enough. You need the experience, the practice that any language requires to be
a proficient speaker, and Java is really just another language. The Syntax started as a barrier, but I 
was actually able to figure that stuff out fairly quickly. 

If I had practic with Java, I'm sure I'd have all of the tools at my disposal to solve the problems I 
faced quicker and with much better results.
