# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Blindsweeper

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Minesweeper, but based off of sound,not sight

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

upon the running of the program, the game will atutomatically start... 

You will be presented with a default 8x8 tile set on the screen.

upon pressig a tile, a set of contiguous empty tiles (so no mines nearby) will reveal themselves. This will be a guranteed safespace... the size will vary randomly

from there, its all up to your ears! if a player hoovers his mouse over an area with a bomb nearby, the program will play beeping sounds whose number corresponds to the number of bombs within a 9x9 area of that tile.

clear every tile WITHOUT clicking on a mine to win! Flags are still available with a right-click

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Creating a default space for the game to take place... I'm really not confident in my Java skills.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

At the very least, a minesweeper clone (WITHOUT the numbers on the dangerous tiles of course)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Everything outlined above...
Sound playing,
and an actual game of minesweeper

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Learning Java, an interface to use java in, and figuring out how on earth to work Github so I can turn the darned thing in
